// Unstick the session-logs stack before applying it.
//
// The workflow (.github/workflows/session-logs.yml) exists so the stack never
// needs admin credentials on somebody's machine. A stack in
// UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED breaks that: it cannot be updated, so every later
// dispatch fails, and clearing it takes a `continue-update-rollback`. The
// deploy role (infra/deploy-role.cfn.yml) holds
// `cloudformation:ContinueUpdateRollback` on the stack, and this calls it.
//
// Run before the deploy step:
//
//   node scripts/cfn-continue-stalled-rollback.mjs <stack-name>
//
// It is a no-op on a healthy stack and on an absent one.
//
// It will NOT clear a ROLLBACK_COMPLETE or a ROLLBACK_FAILED, a failed FIRST
// create in the two spellings it leaves behind. Only a delete clears either,
// and the role holds no DeleteStack on purpose: continuing a rollback only
// moves a stack toward its last working state, a delete does not. So it
// refuses and says which credentials the operator needs, rather than letting
// the deploy fail later with an error about change sets.

 * The exit code says only that the call failed, so an AccessDenied, a throttle
 * or an unreachable endpoint looks exactly like a first apply. Taken for
 * absence, a stack genuinely stuck in UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED is never
 * continued — the one job this script has — and the operator is told it does
 * not exist, which is the delete-with-admin-credentials path and the
 * wrong one entirely. CloudFormation spells the real absence `... does not exist`, so
 * that, rather than the exit status, is what tells the two apart.
